Project on Detection of Alzheimers using CNN
In today’s world Deep Learning techniques have successfully brought change in numerous fields including medical image analysis.
We propose a deep CNN for Alzheimer’s disease using MRI scan data sets. 
Our model identifies Alzheimer’s disease in its different stages using different CNN architectures to 
obtain efficiency and accuracy for early-stage diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.
